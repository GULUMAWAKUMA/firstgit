i am guluma and i starting to learn git and github

upto now i understand some basic concept of git and git hub
for example
git init// git initiate
git config --global user.emal and user.name
then
how to:
git add .
git commit -m 'comment'
 then how to create branches:
git branch
git branch new_branch
git branch
git checkout new_branch

then after modifying the new branch we merge 
new_branch into original or master branch by:

git merge new_brach//we write this command in master branch

if we want to delete the new branch we use:
git branch -d new_branch

this all are used in local or in our computer if wanna to add this into our git hub 
account we use:
git remote add origin https://github.com/GULUMAWAKUMA/firstgit.git
then
git branch -m main

then we must push our file so,
we use
git push -u origin main
